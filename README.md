# Project: Mastermind
A project for the Odin Project Ruby Course

### Assignment
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.

Then, refactor your code to allow the human player to choose whether they want to be the creater of the secret code or the guesser.

Build it out so that the computer will guess if you decide to choose your own secret colors. You my choose to implement a computer strategy that follows the rules of the game or you can modify these rules.
